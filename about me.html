      <h2>Hiking</h2>
      <p>
        I love being able to disconnect from reality for a little and be
        surrounded by nature. I have a whole journal dedicated to my favorite
        trails in the North GA mountains. At a young age my dad would always
        take me hiking during the weekends. I have tried to carry on the
        tradition now as I am in my late 20's.

        Before my dog Leia passed away she would always love to enjoy the trails
        with me, being able to jump in the water was her favorite part.During
        her lifetime we were able to explore over 50 trails together.

      <h2>My Pets</h2>
      <p>
        Having a pet(or a few) is always a must in my household. I tend to think
        that pets are better then most people. Growing up I would always try to
        bring in strays. I even tried to "rescue" some tadpoles I found in a
        stream because I thought they didn't have enough water.

        As of now I have 2 kittens that we adopted from
        <a href="https://www.windyridgerescue.org">Windy Ridge Rescue</a>. Our
        kittens have their own little set up in our gaming room but they love to
        just sit in our laps and watch us play. We also have a crawfish, he goes
        by Rob the Lob.
