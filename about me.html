      <h2>Hiking</h2>
      <p>
        I love being able to disconnect from reality for a little and be
        surrounded by nature. I have a whole journal dedicated to my favorite
        trails in the North GA mountains. At a young age my dad would always
        take me hiking during the weekends. I have tried to carry on the
        tradition now as I am in my late 20's.

        Before my dog passed away she would always love to enjoy the trails with
        me, being able to jump in the water was her favorite part.During her
        lifetime we were able to explore over 50 trails together.
