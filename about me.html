      <h2>Hiking</h2>
      <p>
        I love being able to disconnect from reality for a little and be
        surrounded by nature. I have a whole journal dedicated to my favorite
        trails in the North GA mountains. At a young age my dad would always
        take me hiking during the weekends. I have tried to carry on the
        tradition now as I am in my late 20's.
      </p>

        Before my dog Leia passed away she would always love to enjoy the trails
        with me, being able to jump in the water was her favorite part.During
        her lifetime we were able to explore over 50 trails together.

        If you want to hike with your pet, I recommend using
        <a href="https://www.bringfido.com">Bring Fido</a> Another great website
        I used to help me find trails was
        <a href="https://www.atlantatrails.com">Atlanta Trails</a>

      <h2>My Pets</h2>
      <p>
        Having a pet(or a few) is always a must in my household. I tend to think
        that pets are better then most people. Growing up I would always try to
        bring in strays. I even tried to "rescue" some tadpoles I found in a
        stream because I thought they didn't have enough water.
      </p>

      <p>
        As of now I have 2 kittens that we adopted from
        <a href="https://www.windyridgerescue.org">Windy Ridge Rescue</a>. Our
        kittens have their own little set up in our gaming room but they love to
        just sit in our laps and watch us play. We also have a crawfish, he goes
        by Rob the Lob.

    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>
      I have always had a love for the world of gaming. One of the first games I
      played was on Playstation, it was scooby doo. Being able to immerse myself
      in a different world is very exciting to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to spend my free time playing New World now with my friends. All of
      the people I play with are those who I have met in the online world. We
      have years of gaming together. Its quite special to me that these
      strangers I have met in a game end up becoming some of the closest people
      to me. The gaming community can be harsh, but once you find your people,
      its an amazing experience in my opinion. Some of my favorite gamer
      Youtubers to watch are
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BAMsPG">BAM</a> and
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gingerworldgaming"

      Recently we have been able to complete our gaming room set up. We love it,
      and as I said previously our cats love to watch us play.
